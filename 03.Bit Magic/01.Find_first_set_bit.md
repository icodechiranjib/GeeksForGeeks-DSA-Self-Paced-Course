# Find first set bit

Given an integer an **N.** The task is to return the position of **first set bit found from the right side** in the binary representation of the number.  
**Note:** If there is no set bit in the integer N, then return 0 from the function.  
## Example 1:

```
Input: N = 18
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary representation of 
18 is 010010,the first set bit from the 
right side is at position 2.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: N = 12 
Output: 3 
Explanation: Binary representation 
of  12 is 1100, the first set bit 
from the right side is at position 3.
```

## Your Task:
The task is to complete the function **getFirstSetBit()** that takes an integer n as a **parameter** and returns the **position of first set bit.**

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(logN)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
0 <= N <= 10⁸

## Solution
```java
//User function Template for Java

class Solution
{
    //Function to find position of first set bit in the given number.
    public static int getFirstSetBit(int n){
            
        // Your code here
        if(n==0)
            return 0;
        return (int)(Math.log10(n & -n)/Math.log10(2))+1;
    }
}

```

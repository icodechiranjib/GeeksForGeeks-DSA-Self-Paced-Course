# Rightmost different bit 

Given two numbers M and N. The task is to find the position of the rightmost different bit in the binary representation of numbers. 
## Example 1:

```
Input: M = 11, N = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary representation of the given 
numbers are: 1011 and 1001, 
2nd bit from right is different.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: M = 52, N = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: Binary representation of the given 
numbers are: 110100 and 0100, 
5th-bit from right is different.
```

## Your Task:
The task is to complete the function **posOfRightMostDiffBit()** which takes **two arguments m and n** and returns the **position of first different bits in m and n.** If both m and n are the same then return **-1** in this case.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(max(logm, logn))  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
1 <= M <= 10⁹  
1 <= N <= 10⁹

## Solution
```java
//User function Template for Java

class Solution
{
    //Function to find the first position with different bits.
    public static int posOfRightMostDiffBit(int m, int n)
    {
            
        // Your code here        
        int res = m ^ n;
        return (int)(Math.log10(res & -res)/Math.log10(2))+1;
    }
}
```

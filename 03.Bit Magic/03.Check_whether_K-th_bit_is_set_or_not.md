# Check whether K-th bit is set or not 

Given a number **N** and a bit number **K**, check if **Kᵗʰ** bit of N is **set or not.** A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be **indexed starting with 0** from **LSB** side in binary representation of the number.

## Example 1:

```
Input: N = 4, K = 0
Output: No
Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100, 
in which 0th bit from LSB is not set. 
So, return false.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: N = 4, K = 2
Output: Yes
Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100, 
in which 2nd bit from LSB is set. 
So, return true.
```

## Example 3:
```
Input: N = 500, K = 3
Output: No
Explanation: Binary representation of 500 is 
111110100, in which 3rd bit from LSB is not set. 
So, return false.
```

## Your Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the **function checkKthbit** that takes **n and k as parameters** and **returns** either **true** (if kth bit is set) or **false**(if kth bit is not set).

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(LogN)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁹  
0 ≤ K ≤ floor(log₂(N) + 1)

## Solution
```java
//User function Template for Java
class CheckBit
{
    // Function to check if Kth bit is set or not.
    static boolean checkKthBit(int n, int k)
    {
        // Your code here
        if((n & (1<<k)) == 0){
            return false;
        }else{
            return true;
        }
    }   
}
```

# Bit Difference

You are given two numbers **A** and **B**. The task is to **count the number of bits needed to be flipped** to **convert** A to B.

## Example 1:

```
Input: A = 10, B = 20
Output: 4
Explanation:
A  = 01010
B  = 10100
As we can see, the bits of A that need 
to be flipped are 01010. If we flip 
these bits, we get 10100, which is B.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: A = 20, B = 25
Output: 3
Explanation:
A  = 10100
B  = 11001
As we can see, the bits of A that need 
to be flipped are 10100. If we flip 
these bits, we get 11001, which is B.
```

## Your Task:
**Your Task:** The task is to complete the function **countBitsFlip()** that **takes A and B** as parameters and **returns** the **count** of the **number of bits to be flipped** to convert **A to B.**

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(log N)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10⁶

## Solution
```java
//User function Template for Java

class Solution{
    
    // Function to find number of bits needed to be flipped to convert A to B
    public static int countBitsFlip(int a, int b){
        
        // Your code here
        int count =0 ;
        int res = a ^ b;
        while(res!=0){
            res = res & (res-1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

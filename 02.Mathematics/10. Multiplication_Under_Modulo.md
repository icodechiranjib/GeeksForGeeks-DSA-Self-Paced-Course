#  Multiplication Under Modulo 

Given two numbers a and b, find the sum of **a and b**. You need to find the multiplication of **a and b** under modulo **M (**M as **10⁹+7)**.

## Example 1:

```
Input:
a = 92233720368547758
b = 92233720368547758
Output: 484266119
Explanation: Multiplication of a and b 
under modulo M will be 484266119.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:
a = 1000000007
b = 1000000007
Output: 0
Explanation: Multiplication of a and b
under modulo M is 0.
```

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **multiplicationUnderModulo()** that takes **a and b as parameters** and **returns multiplication** of a and b under modulo M.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
1<=a, b<=2⁶³-1

## Solution
```java
//User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    public static long sumUnderModulo(long a, long b){
        // code here
        long c = (long)Math.pow(10,9)+7;
        return ((a%c)*(b%c))%c;
    }   
}

```

# Absolute Mean

You are given an integer I, find the absolute value of the integer I.

## Example 1:

```
Input:
I = -32
Output: 32
Explanation: 
The absolute value of -32 is 32.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:
I = 45
Output: 45
Explanation: 
The absolute value of 45 is 45 itself.
```

## Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function absolute() which takes an integer I as an input parameter and return the absolute value of I.


**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
-10⁶ <= I <= 10⁶





```java
// User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    public int absolute(int I) {
        // code here
        return Math.abs(I);
    }
}
```

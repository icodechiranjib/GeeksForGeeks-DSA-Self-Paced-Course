#  GP Term

Given the first 2 terms **A and B** of a Geometric Series. The task is to find the **Nᵗʰ** term of the series.

## Example 1:

```
Input:
A = 2 
B = 3
N = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The first term is already
given in the input as 2
```

## Example 2:

```
Input:
A = 1
B = 2
N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Common ratio = 2,
Hence second term is 2.
```

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **termOfGP()** that takes **A, B and N** as parameter and returns **Nᵗʰ** term of **GP**. The **return value** should be **double** that would be **automatically** converted to **floor** by the **driver code**.


**Expected Time Complexity:** O(logN)  
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

**Constraints:**  
-100 <= A <= 100  
-100 <= B <= 100  
1 <= N <= 5


## Solution
```java
//User function Template for Java

class Solution
{
    public double termOfGP(int A,int B,int N)
    {
        //Your code here
        double R = (double)B/A;
        return A * Math.pow(R,N-1);
    }
}

```
